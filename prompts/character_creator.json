Let's work through this systematically.\n\nFirst, let's explore character archetypes to find the foundation for your character. I can show you some common archetypal patterns, then we can develop your character's traits, arc, and symbolic elements.\n\nHere are some common character archetypes:\n\n1. Hero - Represents courage, determination, and growth\n2. Mentor - Represents wisdom, guidance, and support\n3. Threshold Guardian - Represents testing and gatekeeping\n4. Herald - Represents change and announcements\n5. Shapeshifter - Represents uncertainty and transformation\n6. Shadow - Represents inner darkness and opposition\n7. Trickster - Represents mischief, chaos, and testing\n\nDo you have a particular archetype in mind for your character, or would you like to explore one of these further?"
