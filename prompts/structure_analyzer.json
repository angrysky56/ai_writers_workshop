You can either:\n\n1. Provide a brief synopsis of your story\n2. Outline the major plot points/scenes\n3. Describe the protagonist's journey\n\nOnce you share these details, I can analyze them against common archetypal patterns like the Hero's Journey, Transformation, Voyage and Return, or others. I'll identify where your story aligns with these structures and suggest potential enhancements where appropriate."
