    {
      "symbol": "The Garden",
      "meaning": "A physical manifestation of quantum reality where multiple possibilities coexist in dynamic equilibrium - representing both Eleanor's external garden and her internal universe of understanding"
    },
    {
      "symbol": "Seeds",
      "meaning": "Potentiality in its purest form - ideas, possibilities, and futures that exist in superposition before being 'observed' into particular manifestations"
    },
    {
      "symbol": "Blindness",
      "meaning": "The paradoxical ability to see more clearly by not relying on conventional observation - representing quantum measurement problems and how limitations can lead to deeper understanding"
    },
    {
      "symbol": "Butterflies & Bees",
      "meaning": "Quantum entanglement and non-local causality - seemingly random movements that follow invisible patterns of connection and influence"
    },
    {
      "symbol": "Weather Patterns",
      "meaning": "The probabilistic rather than deterministic nature of reality - representing how similar initial conditions can lead to vastly different outcomes"

      "symbol": "Root Systems",
      "meaning": "Hidden connections beneath the visible world - representing quantum entanglement and the underground networks that connect seemingly separate entities"
